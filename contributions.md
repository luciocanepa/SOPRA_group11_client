# Contributions

Every member has to complete at least 2 meaningful tasks per week, where a
single development task should have a granularity of 0.5-1 day. The completed
tasks have to be shown in the weekly TA meetings. You have one "Joker" to miss
one weekly TA meeting and another "Joker" to once skip continuous progress over
the remaining weeks of the course. Please note that you cannot make up for
"missed" continuous progress, but you can "work ahead" by completing twice the
amount of work in one week to skip progress on a subsequent week without using
your "Joker". Please communicate your planning **ahead of time**.

Note: If a team member fails to show continuous progress after using their
Joker, they will individually fail the overall course (unless there is a valid
reason).

**You MUST**:

- Have two meaningful contributions per week.

**You CAN**:

- Have more than one commit per contribution.
- Have more than two contributions per week.
- Link issues to contributions descriptions for better traceability.

**You CANNOT**:

- Link the same commit more than once.
- Use a commit authored by another GitHub user.

Now instead of only updating statuses of users, it handles updates to all group-related stuff, like updates to the group name, description, or if a member changes the username or the status changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | This ensures that users will see real time updates of changes, including status changes, without having to constantly refresh the page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

This includes the timer, participants list, and a spaceholder for other extra features like invite users or plan a session.

This page represents the main functionality of our app with the timer and the collaborative features. The chat (not yet implemented - it needs WebSocket) is only visible when the timer is not running - ensuring no distraction when studying and the possiblity to chat with others when in a break. |

Only the admin user can update and delete a group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Securitywise this is crucial. Especially now every call made from a user needs to pass a token for authentication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

With the id also being stored in the localStorage, the GET user and matching the user-object’s token to the token that was stored in the local storage, is solved in a better/different way. The logic of having to fetch all the users and then find the correct one is now redundant. This had to be changed on the dashboard and group pages. Now, new group creations do not throw error 409 anymore, because the comparison actually evaluates to true. The correct user can be found and his id will now correctly be set to the adminId.

Another issue that came up after merging main into the manageProfile branch was the fact that the birthday form item seemed to have a bug. When opening the datepicker to choose a birthday the dates were jumping around and the monthly view of dates was not even ordered, making it impossible to choose the wanted date. I had to install `dayjs` for the date and not use moments as before (but keeping moments for the timezones). Another bug i found was the fact that after choosing eg. 11.04 it automatically stored it as 10.04 by adding `startOf('day‘)` this issue did seem to appear anymore. | This commit was relevant, because otherwise there would be some bugs in our programm which we want to avoid.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The status of members now updates in real time for other users on the group dashboard. I also added a column for time remaining.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Now, when the status of a user changes and the user is part of a group, other users that are currently on the group dashboard can always see whenever the status of a user changes in real time, therefore knowing if they for example see the chat, are also studying, are online or offline.                                                                                                                           |

Additionally, I adjusted the time remaining display on the group page, now working correctly in real time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | now, the server knows when the user interacted with the timer (start, stop, reset), and other users of the group can see the time remaining on the timer in real time on the group dashboard. This ensures that users are always informed about other users and can plan ahead when a user will become available. Users can also try and synchronize with other users if they do not want to send a sync break reqeust.  |

Users with existing google accounts should now be able to sign in, and then plan future study sessions. The possibility to log out of your calendar is also given. To set a session, Date and StartTime are needed, and if no EndTime is given it will automatically end at StarTime+1 hour. Entries in the google calendar will have the group name displayed so a user knows in which group he should start the pomodoro-timer.

The related code is now in a separate component/CalendarAPI file instead of groups/gid. I imported stylings from login.css and edit.css but the TimePicker still needed some more styling, in order to get black on white values (instead of white on white) so i added a new calendarAPI.css to do it. I also changed the color of the TimePicker’s „ok“-button from the default bright green to a red that matches our page. Then I added styling for the buttons, so their colors and alignments fit this component. Additionally, on google cloud the API is now „published“ and not in „testing“ anymore and I also added the vercel links to the google cloud configuration. | In order to have a good/better user experience it is necessary for the users to get a unified styling and actually see the numbers and text that is being displayed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The websocket with STOMP ensures fast messaging, while the "own/others messages"-design makes it easy to see who sent each message. The messages get "saved" in the localstorage and after 500, the oldest one gets deleted with every new message, ensuring the localstorage limit doesnt get reached. |

For this, I also had to add startTime and duration to the UserGetDTO and adjust the DTOMapper accordingly.             | Now, users can see the correct time remaining of the other group members if they are working when loading into the page. Also, the logic is now more intuitive, with "BREAK" only applying to users actively in the break timer, and with online or offline users having no active timer shown. |

| **sharonisler** | 17.05.2025  | [CalendarAPI #76](https://github.com/luciocanepa/SOPRA_group11_client/commit/44f36a2a37d0b05388695bc23185fe89107addb7)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | As discussed with the group, I changed how the Plan Session Modal opens. Instead of a pop-up window in the middle of the screen, the modal will fold out of the button, as it does when clicking on the invite users button. Additionally, I changed the format of the Form in order to take up less space. (start and end time now are now on one line, as are the buttons for the form). I deleted the intermediate (modal-)page“ with the buttons „create entry“ and „log out“, and moved the „log out of google“- button to the form-page (replacing the back (to the intermediate page)- button). Viewing the upcoming events that other users have planned, is now also a modal and folds out of the button like the other modals. There was also an issue with the logic when adding an event that a user with a different timezone created. Now every event is converted and being stored as the default Europe/Zurich timezone. And the events are also displayed according to timezone (user1 and user2 may not have the same times displayed in the „view upcoming sessions“ modal, depending on their timezones!) | This was relevant since I had to fix some logic issues and also unify the design of our group page in to get a better UX                                                                                                                                          |

I also initiated a proper Form with onFinish() rules and htmlType = „submit“ instead of onChange() for every form-entry. Changing the mapping of the POST and GET requests from calendar-entries/group/gid to group/gid/calendar-entries to have a cleaner code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | This was relevant in order to have clearer mappings and code, as well as a unified message handling via toast instead of alerts.                                                                                                                                  |

I removed all the `session.set()` since they were not needed, and I also added some if-statements that throw exceptions in order to correctly validate the user. Making sure that the user/token is valid and that the user is part of this group. Also, now when the admin deletes the group, all planned sessions that are connected to the group are deleted from the database. And second commit: The `orphanRemoval = true` led to 18 test failures and therefore caused some build issues. Since single calendar entries cannot be deleted from the group this line is not needed. (However keeping the functionality that when a group is deleted the related calendar entries are also being deleted).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | These commits were relevant in order to have a clear/clean database handling and better mappings. The second was crucial for the build and merge to work.                                                                                                         |

| **annapangUZH** | 18.05.2025  | - [basic sync timer feature draft #81](https://github.com/luciocanepa/SOPRA_group11_client/commit/9a568d8ee91bfff067746340e6d81b7148d6e85e). <br>- [minor change](https://github.com/luciocanepa/SOPRA_group11_client/commit/b81c4e68d8ae65981f613e8237772e20b1d6b23c). <br>- [logic adjustment and Break Time fix try](https://github.com/luciocanepa/SOPRA_group11_client/commit/ffd881536773633658f523f3d92bee36aecd4ef8).<br> | I added the sync timer feature so that users can sync their timers and match each others working / break rhythm. The third commit was the changing of the logic and how the client uses "duration" and "secondDuration" while also trying to fix the syncing of Break Time issues. Plus, I had to change the grouppage, since after the API got integrated, the sync timer feature was buggy. I used the already working sync timer logic from commit 2 and put this together with the new API logic. There are still some issues which are really weird: time remaining display freezes as soon as the users enter break session, and whenever the users switch session, the starttime is a few seconds ahead, with each session-switch making this gap bigger                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | sync timer feature is good for group collaboration: users can work together and have the break together at the same time, and it can also increase motivation being able to work with others in sync                                                              |

I fixed one of the two issues, where the time remaining display in group participants is frozen as soon as users enter the break state. It now correctly counts down. | Now, Users can see how much time the other team members have left if they're in a break.                                                                                                                                          |
| **annapangUZH** | 20.05.2025  | - [Frontend: Sync Timer Fix 2 #81](https://github.com/luciocanepa/SOPRA_group11_client/commit/818142e9652bcc1284cb3cd50c7471ae136ced46)<br>- [Backend: Sync Timer Fix 2 #81](https://github.com/luciocanepa/SOPRA_group11_server/commit/bacb978f84b4b9270cd96f8b76c7b5f9c7c41cac)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Before, after syncing the timers, as soon as users enter the next state (for example, from WORK to BREAK), it had a small headstart of a few seconds. Another issue was that after syncing, the receiver of the sync request only gets his other session length overridden with the new length, not the current session length. Fixing the headstart got fixed, but another issue got introduced, that when syncing, the timer of the receiver of the sync request gets changed to the original start time again, instead of the sender's current remaining time. I resolved the whole issue by adding a new variable originalDuration, which saves the full length of the current session the sender is in, while secondDuration saves the full length of the other session, and duration stores the current remaining time. I also added the new variable to the Backend, and I added a time converter to DTOMapper so that the startTime is converted to UTC format, aligning to what the Frontend expects (Backend commit).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Now, syncing timers works properly, with users staying synced after multiple sesion switches, unless a user manually changes their timer.                                                                                                                                  |

But when trying to use it, the input-field is incredibly narrow, and users cannot see what they're typing. Autocomplete was also not readable. I added a new stylesheet (InviteUser.css) to fix this. | Now, the invite user feature is looking normal again and users can actually use it properly.                                                                                                                                          |
| **annapangUZH** | 21.05.2025  | [Frontend: Fixed wrong timer display when refreshing page](https://github.com/luciocanepa/SOPRA_group11_client/commit/0c9a2b71250317980e692d2d119adfb436844c05)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Before, when a user refreshed their page when their timer was running, the timer just got reset. I fixed this, which introduced another bug: when a user resets their timer, then immediately refreshes the page, and starts the timer again, it's always showing the break session interface. This is also fixed now. | This ensures that a user's session and rhythm don't get interrupted upon refreshing the page.                                                                                                                                          |

Informs the user. |
| **HelinCapan** | 21.05.2025 | [Browser Notif SR #85](https://github.com/luciocanepa/SOPRA_group11_client/commit/df8687e0475be4221ec2481ea7f056f7e8b43d72) | Added browser notification for incoming sync requests, added tomato icon to all browser notifications | Improves UX: User don't miss requests that they would have otherwise missed if they weren't on the apps window/page |
