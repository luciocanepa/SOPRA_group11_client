# Contributions

Every member has to complete at least 2 meaningful tasks per week, where a
single development task should have a granularity of 0.5-1 day. The completed
tasks have to be shown in the weekly TA meetings. You have one "Joker" to miss
one weekly TA meeting and another "Joker" to once skip continuous progress over
the remaining weeks of the course. Please note that you cannot make up for
"missed" continuous progress, but you can "work ahead" by completing twice the
amount of work in one week to skip progress on a subsequent week without using
your "Joker". Please communicate your planning **ahead of time**.

Note: If a team member fails to show continuous progress after using their
Joker, they will individually fail the overall course (unless there is a valid
reason).

**You MUST**:

- Have two meaningful contributions per week.

**You CAN**:

- Have more than one commit per contribution.
- Have more than two contributions per week.
- Link issues to contributions descriptions for better traceability.

**You CANNOT**:

- Link the same commit more than once.
- Use a commit authored by another GitHub user.

Now instead of only updating statuses of users, it handles updates to all group-related stuff, like updates to the group name, description, or if a member changes the username or the status changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | This ensures that users will see real time updates of changes, including status changes, without having to constantly refresh the page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

This includes the timer, participants list, and a spaceholder for other extra features like invite users or plan a session.

This page represents the main functionality of our app with the timer and the collaborative features. The chat (not yet implemented - it needs WebSocket) is only visible when the timer is not running - ensuring no distraction when studying and the possiblity to chat with others when in a break. |

Only the admin user can update and delete a group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Securitywise this is crucial. Especially now every call made from a user needs to pass a token for authentication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

With the id also being stored in the localStorage, the GET user and matching the user-object’s token to the token that was stored in the local storage, is solved in a better/different way. The logic of having to fetch all the users and then find the correct one is now redundant. This had to be changed on the dashboard and group pages. Now, new group creations do not throw error 409 anymore, because the comparison actually evaluates to true. The correct user can be found and his id will now correctly be set to the adminId.

Another issue that came up after merging main into the manageProfile branch was the fact that the birthday form item seemed to have a bug. When opening the datepicker to choose a birthday the dates were jumping around and the monthly view of dates was not even ordered, making it impossible to choose the wanted date. I had to install `dayjs` for the date and not use moments as before (but keeping moments for the timezones). Another bug i found was the fact that after choosing eg. 11.04 it automatically stored it as 10.04 by adding `startOf('day‘)` this issue did seem to appear anymore. | This commit was relevant, because otherwise there would be some bugs in our programm which we want to avoid.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The status of members now updates in real time for other users on the group dashboard. I also added a column for time remaining.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Now, when the status of a user changes and the user is part of a group, other users that are currently on the group dashboard can always see whenever the status of a user changes in real time, therefore knowing if they for example see the chat, are also studying, are online or offline.                                                                                                                           |

Additionally, I adjusted the time remaining display on the group page, now working correctly in real time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | now, the server knows when the user interacted with the timer (start, stop, reset), and other users of the group can see the time remaining on the timer in real time on the group dashboard. This ensures that users are always informed about other users and can plan ahead when a user will become available. Users can also try and synchronize with other users if they do not want to send a sync break reqeust.  |

Users with existing google accounts should now be able to sign in, and then plan future study sessions. The possibility to log out of your calendar is also given. To set a session, Date and StartTime are needed, and if no EndTime is given it will automatically end at StarTime+1 hour. Entries in the google calendar will have the group name displayed so a user knows in which group he should start the pomodoro-timer.

The related code is now in a separate component/CalendarAPI file instead of groups/gid. I imported stylings from login.css and edit.css but the TimePicker still needed some more styling, in order to get black on white values (instead of white on white) so i added a new calendarAPI.css to do it. I also changed the color of the TimePicker’s „ok“-button from the default bright green to a red that matches our page. Then I added styling for the buttons, so their colors and alignments fit this component. Additionally, on google cloud the API is now „published“ and not in „testing“ anymore and I also added the vercel links to the google cloud configuration. | In order to have a good/better user experience it is necessary for the users to get a unified styling and actually see the numbers and text that is being displayed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The websocket with STOMP ensures fast messaging, while the "own/others messages"-design makes it easy to see who sent each message. The messages get "saved" in the localstorage and after 500, the oldest one gets deleted with every new message, ensuring the localstorage limit doesnt get reached. |

| **annapangUZH** | 10.05.2025 | Commit 1: [Time remaining display](https://github.com/luciocanepa/SOPRA_group11_client/commit/f661c5a61fef36dae4b362c22698a24b75b45f6c)<br>Commit 2: [Time remaining display final fix](https://github.com/luciocanepa/SOPRA_group11_client/commit/769c280195e406b6e9caa8a9c4f9edfa2bbc69dd) | I fixed multiple things:<br>- Whenever someone stops or resets their timer, their status is switched to online instead of break.<br>- the time remaining section for online or offline users is hidden.<br>- The update timer settings now works correctly (before it just started counting down immediately after applying).<br>- Commit 2: When a user loads into a group page, the time remaining is shown correctly to them (before it was hidden for everyone). | Now, users can see the correct time remaining of the other group members if they are working when loading into the page, and don't see it if they are online or offline, which would have been confusing. The status also makes more sense now, with if a user manually stops the timer, they are online instead of in a break. |

I also replaced the current favicon.ico with a new one (tomato). | It enhances the user experience with fitting metadata (not Student XX-XXX-XXX) and a fitting icon as well and also is useful for information as you can tell which page you are on from the browser-tab title. |
