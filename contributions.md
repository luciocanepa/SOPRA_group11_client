# Contributions

Every member has to complete at least 2 meaningful tasks per week, where a
single development task should have a granularity of 0.5-1 day. The completed
tasks have to be shown in the weekly TA meetings. You have one "Joker" to miss
one weekly TA meeting and another "Joker" to once skip continuous progress over
the remaining weeks of the course. Please note that you cannot make up for
"missed" continuous progress, but you can "work ahead" by completing twice the
amount of work in one week to skip progress on a subsequent week without using
your "Joker". Please communicate your planning **ahead of time**.

Note: If a team member fails to show continuous progress after using their
Joker, they will individually fail the overall course (unless there is a valid
reason).

**You MUST**:

- Have two meaningful contributions per week.

**You CAN**:

- Have more than one commit per contribution.
- Have more than two contributions per week.
- Link issues to contributions descriptions for better traceability.

**You CANNOT**:

- Link the same commit more than once.
- Use a commit authored by another GitHub user.

| ------------------ | -------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **@annapangUZH** | 30.03.2025   | I used multiple commits per contribution, I have enumerated them.<br/>Commit 1.1: https://github.com/luciocanepa/SOPRA_group11_client/commit/e83873bd5e9276057efac216ac14bc9a64a44fdb<br/>Commit 1.2: https://github.com/luciocanepa/SOPRA_group11_client/commit/718088889c211c18dbaa7c7fad1631aa0bed97db<br/>Commit 1.3: https://github.com/luciocanepa/SOPRA_group11_client/commit/42f6ba7635b0eb0f985ffa3a36759d2a9de6b119 | I created the register page, where a user can register with a username and password to get to the dashboard. They can also go to the log-in page. It corresponds to issue #9. | This contribution ensures that a user can register and create an account to access the Pomodoro Study Room and all its functionalities. |
|                    | 30.03.2025   | Commit 2.1: https://github.com/luciocanepa/SOPRA_group11_client/commit/8e4e7963207b1a66f336b8d05fe74947168082a3<br/>Commit 2.2: https://github.com/luciocanepa/SOPRA_group11_client/commit/09184da41a987199a41ad38fe358bdd35836d20f<br/>Commit 2.3: https://github.com/luciocanepa/SOPRA_group11_client/commit/56c549a2475b1ec73e4fdac647ef9f67965e35c6 | I created a hook and component for User Status Updates in real time using Websockets. The client gets constant updates of user status and displays them in real-time. It corresponds to issue #1. | This contribution ensures collaboration: users can view the status of group members in order to stay informed about the members' availability to chat, sync breaks, or study together. |
| **@sharonisler** | 30.03.2025   | https://github.com/luciocanepa/SOPRA_group11_client/commit/5e3502fb26f19ff9d634ca66eacdff1c13d72388 | I made a group registration form, where a user can enter all the necessary credentials (images are stored as base64 strings). The group.css file stores all the styling formats (color, background, containers etc.) Upon creating the group we currently get redirected to the dashboard page. | Creating a group is important for the collaborative aspect of our project. |
|                    | 30.03.2025   | https://github.com/luciocanepa/SOPRA_group11_client/commits/dashboard/ | I made the dashboard which has buttons directing us to statistics, pomodoro timer, profile edit page and one which will handle the logout of the user directing us to the login page. The last element of this dashboard is the group container. This should (always) display the button „create new user“ which will lead to the group registration form. And additionally if the user already is member of some groups, they will also be displayed in here. The functionality of it: fetching the user that is logged in, then fetching all groups and check for each if the user id appears in the list of group-members. Also the dashboard.css that contains all the styles for this UI | This is relevant since our logged in users need a welcome/overview page. |
| **@HelinCapan** | 30.03.2025   | [Link Timer Commit 1.1](https://github.com/luciocanepa/SOPRA_group11_client/commit/4ffb698ca420887dd967f78c8d74935b14c50254) | I have made a pomodoro timer with start, stop, reset buttons. The implementation also includes a “timer settings” button with which the user can change the interval times. I also added an alarm that rings when each study/break session ends. Issue Nr: 7 | The timer is the heart piece of our WebApp and ensures that the Users have a working and useable timer for their studies. This will be used in the group dashboard. |
|                    | 30.03.25   | [Link Timer Commit 1.2](https://github.com/luciocanepa/SOPRA_group11_client/commit/f92593cea1b1eea6a3a1a690dac38df9f6047d5e)  | see above - this was mostly a major rework of the design. Issue Nr: 7 | Better UI. This contribution aims and ensures to make the timer UI look like the mockup while ensuring its functionalities work. |
| **@HelinCapan** | 30.03.2025   | [Link Participants Commit](https://github.com/luciocanepa/SOPRA_group11_client/commit/d7e4e22b4cc277dcb5fe11c643c7819aa6d6f455) | I have made the specific groups participants/group members display; showing the user and their status. Issue Nr: 5 | This contribution gives users the ability to check who is in their study group, making the webapp more interactive. This will also be useful for the admin. This will also be used in the group dashboard (when break). |
